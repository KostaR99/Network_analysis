# Network_analysis
Program used for analysis of undirected affinity graphs

# Functionalities

1. Detecting clusters of the given graph
2. Creating set of clusters represented as graphs
3. Checking if the graph is clusterable
4. Creating a graph of clusters
5. Detecting giant component
6. Structural analysis

# Graph loading

Graphs that are used in this project are:

1. Epinions graph
2. Slashdot graph
3. Wiki-RfA graph
4. Random graph, that can be clusterable or unclusterable
5. Two small hand crafted graphs

Epinions, slashdot and wiki-RfA are converted to undirected graphs. They can be found on <a href ="https://snap.stanford.edu/data/">this link</a>

Things to add:

Visualisations for graphs, better ui, graph-tool conversion for better performances.
